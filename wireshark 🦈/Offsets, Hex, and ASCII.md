**Offsets, Hex, and ASCII**
![[Pasted image 20220525201930.png]]
You can see the Packet Bytes pane is divided into three columns. The first, left-most column simply counts incrementally: 0000, 0010, 0020, and so on. That's the offset (in hexadecimal) of the selected packet. Here, offset simply means the number of bits off from the beginning— again, counting in hexadecimal (where 0x0010 = 16 in decimal). The middle column shows information, in hexadecimal, at that offset. The right-hand column shows the same information, but in ASCII. For example, the total amount of information from the very beginning (offset 0000) to offset 0010 is 16 bytes. The middle column shows each of the 16 bytes in hex. The right-hand column shows each of the 16 bytes in ASCII characters. When a hexadecimal value doesn't translate to a printable ASCII character, only a “.” (period), is shown. So the Packet Bytes pane is actually the raw packet data as seen by Wireshark. By default, it is displayed in hex bytes.
