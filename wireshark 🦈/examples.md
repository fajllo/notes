display filtring examples:
For example, here are some filters for systems named alpha and beta: 
- host beta (captures all packets to and from the alpha system)
-  ip6 host alpha and not beta (captures all IP packets between alpha and any host except beta) 
- tcp port 80 (captures all TCP traffic across port 80)
