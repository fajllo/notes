For the sake of a limitless web experience, DNS comes to our rescue. DNS stores a dataset (zone file) of website names mapped to their current IP addresses, along with the names of the domains. Each entry in the zone file is termed a resource record (combination of website name and its IP). DNS uses TCP and UDP, both for different purposes, over the port 53 by default.
 How does DNS work? So, as a client, when you try to visit a website from a browser, your request (DNS query) is sent to an internal DNS server (if any) that looks up the resource records it contains. If the DNS server knows the IP address for the domain you are trying to visit, your PC will get a reply (DNS response) containing the IP address of the website you desire to visit, else your query will be forwarded to external DNS servers on the web (for example, google DNS servers at 8.8.8.8, 4.4.2.2, and so on.).
