**Intelligence Pipeline** - application and analysis of data into information and then into intelligence

![[Pasted image 20220616141300.png]]

1. Events are collected and processed to turn them into data.
2. Context and enrichment are added to turn the data into information. 
3. Internal analysis and production are applied to the information to create intelligence. 
4.  Data-driven decisions can be created (as necessary).

mamy dane -> dane po wzpogaceniu o kontekst stają się informacją -> po anazliie stają się eng "intelligence" *danymi wywiadowczymi* -> na ich podstawie pozemy podejmować decyzję *Data-driven decisions*

As an example, you might be informed that "this IP address was observed scanning for exposed unencrypted ports across the internet." This is data, but that's all it is. It isn't really even interesting. It's just the "winds of the internet." Ideally, this data would have context applied, such as "this IP address is scanning for exposed unencrypted ports across the internet for ASNs owned by banks"; additionally, the enrichment added could be that this IP address is associated with the command and control entities of a previously observed malicious campaign.
