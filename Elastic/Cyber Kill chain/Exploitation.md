This phase is performed when the adversary actually exploits the target and executes code on the system. This can be through the use of an exploit against a system vulnerability, the user, or any combination of the lot. An exploit against a system vulnerability is fairly self-explanatory â€“ this either needs to be carried out by tricking the user into opening an attachment or link that executes an exploit condition (**Arbitrary Code Execution** (ACE)) or an exploit that needs to be remotely exploitable (**Remote Code Execution** (RCE)). 
The Exploitation phase is generally the first time that you may notice adversary activity as the Delivery phase relies on organizations getting data, such as email, into their environment. While there are scanners and policies to strip out known bad, adversaries are very successful in using email as an initial access point, so the Exploitation phase is frequently where the first detection occurs.
