This phase is where the adversary makes their attempt to get into the target network. Frequently, this is attempted through phishing (generic, spear-, or whale-phishing, or even through social media). However, this can also be attempted through an insider, a hardware drop (the oddly successful thumb drive in a parking lot), or a remotely exploitable vulnerability. Generally, this is the riskiest part of a campaign as it is the first time that the adversary is "reaching out and touching" their target with something that could tip off defenders that an attack is incoming.
