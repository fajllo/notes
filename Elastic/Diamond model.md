The Diamond Model (The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, Caltagirone, Sergio ; Pendergast, Andrew ; Betz, Christopher, https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/ tr/fulltext/u2/a586960.pdf) was created by a non-profit organization called the Center for Cyber Intelligence Analysis and Threat Research (CCIATR). The paper, titled The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, was released in 2013 with the novel goal to provide a standardized approach to characterize campaigns, differentiate one campaign from another, track their life cycles, and finally, develop countermeasures to mitigate them. The Diamond Model uses a simple visual to illustrate six elements valuable for campaign tracking: Adversary, Infrastructure, Victim, Capabilities, Socio-political, and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP).

Another method for chaining models together is to combine the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain and the Diamond Model. This allows you to associate adversary actions mapped with the Diamond Model with other parallel campaigns, note shared elements between events and campaigns, produce confidence assessments based on your inferences, and also determine how far the adversaries may be in their campaigns:
