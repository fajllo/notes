A Windows workstation was recently compromised, and evidence suggests it was an attack against internet-facing RDP, then Meterpreter was deployed to conduct 'Actions on Objectives'. Can you verify these findings?  
  
You have been provided with the **Security.evtx** and **System.evtx log** exports from the compromised system - you should analyze these, NOT the Windows logs generated by the lab machine (when using DeepBlueCLI ensure you're providing the path to these files, stored inside \Desktop\Investigation\.
