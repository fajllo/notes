MiTeC Windows Registry Recovery is one of many tools that can be used by computer forensic examiners to view registry values. The MiTeC Windows Registry Recovery uses a button system to allow you to view some of the most important registry key values.

The SYSTEM, SECURITY, SAM, and SOFTWARE are the registry files that contain many of these key system configuration values. These registry files are located in the Windows\System32\config directory and provide a wealth of information about the configuration of a Windows system. Some of the values we examined in this final section include the following:

-   Installation Date
-   TCP/IP Settings
-   User accounts
-   User SIDs
-   Services
-   Startup items
