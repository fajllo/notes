#### Overview

Analyzing malware is important for many reasons. Malware analysis in general is taking steps to find out more information about things like who crafted a malware payload, where the malware is becoming to, or what types of actions the malware is trying to perform. Static analysis is where you look at the file contents and look at the strings and don’t execute the file. With dynamic malware analysis, you run the file (likely in a virtual environment not connected to a real network) to see the types of network and process actions that happen to the system

#### Introduction To Malware

Malware, also known a malicious software, is a piece of software that does harm to a computer, a network, server, etc. There are a range of strategies that can be used to control against malware such as antivirus software, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and others. But, even if you followed picture-perfect defense-in-depth strategies, your systems can still be hacked as you will see in this lab. All it takes is a weakness in your protections to allow unauthorized access to systems. This reading assignment will review some common types of malware. This lab demonstrates static and dynamic malware analysis. Static malware analysis takes a virus and determines what it is using the browser and a web site called VirusTotal. With dynamic malware analysis, unlike static analysis, we will run the malware and try to determine the behavior. With Wireshark and other tools, we can try to determine what IP address and port the malware beacons to if it has that capability.

#### Viruses

A virus is a type of malware that typically hides itself into another piece of software that can quickly replicate itself into other applications and files once it runs to create havoc on a system. An antivirus software’s job is to counteract virus by scanning and removing them on systems.

#### Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malware that infects systems by encrypting its files. Then, the attackers will usually demand a ransom to unencrypt the files on the system, payable in Bitcoin using a one-way transaction. Antivirus software and a good backup schedule and policy can be used to help counteract this type of malware.

#### Trojan Horse

A trojan horse is another type of malware the masquerades as a valid application to persuade a victim to install it and/or launch it. Trojans spread through social engineering and brute force hacking of systems.

#### Rootkits

Rootkits are yet another type of malware that is installed on a system. Rootkits are infamous for evading detection, and they can do lots of harm to a system.

#### Backdoors

A backdoor is a type of malware that allows for bypassing the normal authentication procedures on systems.
