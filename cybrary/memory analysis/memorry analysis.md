**Memory Forensics**
Memory forensics is a process of analyzing volatile memory of a computer system. Digital forensics professionals use memory forensics to help them investigate information such as network connections, running processes, and malicious behaviors active in memory.

**Volatile Data**
The operating system reads and writes data to memory in a system’s RAM. Data in RAM is volatile because the data in memory is lost when the system is turned off. Memory can contain information data such as processes, command history, passwords, and files that can be extracted and helpful to forensic investigators.

**Memory Dump And DumpIt**
DumpIt is a command line program that runs on either a 32- or a 64-bit version of Windows. This tool generates a copy of the system’s physical memory and saves it as a file in the same directory from which the command is run. DumpIt can also be run from a drive letter assigned to a USB drive and be stored on the removable media.
