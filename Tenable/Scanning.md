 **Nessus Scaner VS Nessus Agent**

**In a nutshell**, 
traditional active scans originate from a Nessus scanner that reaches out to the hosts targeted for scanning, while agent scans run on hosts regardless of network location or connectivity and then report the results back to the manager (for example, Nessus Manager or Tenable.io) when network connectivity resumes.
