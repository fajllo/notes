**Traditional Active Scans (Non-credentialed)**
A traditional active non-credentialed scan  is a common method for assessing the security of systems without system privileges. Non-credentialed scans enumerate a host's exposed ports, protocols, and services and identifies vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that could allow an attacker to compromise your network
**Benefits :**
	- ideal for large-scale assessments in traditional enterprise environments.
	-  Discovers vulnerabilities that an outside attacker can use to compromise your network (provides a malicious adversary's point of view).
	-  Runs network-based plugins that an agent is restricted from performing.
	- Can perform targeted operations like the brute forcing of credentials. (**spróbowac to zrobić**)
**Limitations:**
	- can sometimes have a negative effect on the network, device, or application you are testing.
	- Misses client-side vulnerabilities such as detailed patch information.
	- Can miss transient devices that are not always connected to the network.
